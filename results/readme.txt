Contains the codes for reproducing results for GSCALE-I algorithm 
Requires 'torch >= 2.0'. 

Execute "main.py" file for reproducing the simulations for the transform $X=tanh(T.Z)$ and execute and "analyze.py" to generate the evaluation metrics presented in the paper.
Change $n$, $d$, $nsamples$, $nsteps_max$, and $lambdaG$ variables appropriately for reproducing various results presented in the paper.
